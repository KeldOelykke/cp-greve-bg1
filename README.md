Board Game for Coding Pirates in Greve

Kids are learning to program in all kinds of ways. This board game is just another way of mixing rules and instructions.

Furthermore, this board game requires collaborative turn based decisions to get the Hero out of the dungeon.
The Monsters will try to delay - or even slay - the Hero, why looting any chests with items of aid might prove to be a good strategy.
